# #1// #1 - GraphQL for Beginners (express-graphql)

- This is only for beginners. Just to know that how graphQL Queries and Resolvers work.
- This also provides nested queries functionality.
- Here, every query is GraphQLObject Type.
- And Resolver is inside the Query.

# #2// #2 - GraphQL wiith typeDefs using apollo-server-express

- This is the alternate and better version of GraphQL.
- This part doesn't contain nested query.
- It's only to show you that how to deal with Queries with custom query type.
- Here, query types (together as typeDefs) and resolvers are separate.
  -Here, express is also used to provide other routes with REST and a separate route for graphQL.

# #3// #3 - GraphQL nested query with custom query resolvers (apollo-server)

- This is the same method as used in #2.
- Here, express is not used.
- This only provides the graphql API service.
- Here, it provides nested queries using custom cuery resolvers.
